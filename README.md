# SAMPLE-CANSAT-GCS
Hey!!
So this is a Sample CANSAT Ground Control System that I made using Javafx and SceneBuilder

This software has the job of collecting data from the Flight Software, and plot/store it in real time. For this functionality, I have used ScheduledExecutorService.
I have also created multiple tabs to view the data in. There is a tab to view 3d cansat models. It has an altimeter and horizon to view the altitude, pitch and roll on the device.
The software also displays the exact position of the carrier on a map.
